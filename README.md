### Description

This application uses data fetched from a remote server (ideally maintained via a CMS), 
to populate an interavtive map with information regarding global, physical office locations.

### The Problem

Prior to this project, several of our websites contained pages with static SVG maps displaying our office locations. 
Due to the fact that there are 90+ offices located around the world, and information like street address, phone number, 
and email addresses regarding these locations frequently changed, maintaining several static pages became impractical.

### The Solution

This process was automated by creating a module on one of our internal sites where information regarding 
office locations could be easy maintained by the Operations team via the CMS. For there, using this data 
to populate a map using a third-party API was straight forward. We even took this a step further by creating a 
script tag that makes installing this map on new pages easy, and documentation that makes map customization simple.
